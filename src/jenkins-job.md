Sure! Here are the detailed steps to set up a Jenkins job that automatically triggers a build when you push to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create a Jenkins Job

1. **Access Jenkins Dashboard**:

   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-jenkins-server>:8080`.

2. **Create a New Item**:

   - Click on "New Item" on the left-hand side of the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Enter a name for your job (e.g., `Observability-Stack-Pipeline`).
   - Select "Pipeline" as the project type.
   - Click "OK" to create the job.

3. **Configure the Pipeline Job**:
   - In the job configuration page, scroll down to the "Pipeline" section.
   - Select "Pipeline script from SCM".
   - Choose "Git" as the SCM.
   - Enter your repository URL (`https://github.com/Chukwuka1488/Observability-Stack-for-Polygon-RPC`).
   - Specify the branch to build (e.g., `main`).
   - Click "Save" to save the job configuration.

### Step 2: Configure Webhooks in GitHub

1. **Access GitHub Repository Settings**:

   - Go to your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/Chukwuka1488/Observability-Stack-for-Polygon-RPC`).
   - Click on "Settings" in the repository menu.

2. **Add a Webhook**:
   - In the settings menu, click on "Webhooks".
   - Click on "Add webhook".
   - In the "Payload URL" field, enter the URL of your Jenkins server followed by `/github-webhook/` (e.g., `http://<your-jenkins-server>:8080/github-webhook/`).
   - Set the "Content type" to `application/json`.
   - Select "Just the push event" under "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?".
   - Click "Add webhook" to save the webhook configuration.

### Step 3: Configure Jenkins Job to Trigger on Push

1. **Access Jenkins Job Configuration**:

   - Go back to your Jenkins dashboard.
   - Click on the job you created (e.g., `Observability-Stack-Pipeline`).
   - Click on "Configure" on the left-hand side.

2. **Enable GitHub Hook Trigger**:
   - Scroll down to the "Build Triggers" section.
   - Check the box for "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling".
   - Click "Save" to save the job configuration.

### Step 4: Verify the Setup

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**:

   - Make a change to your repository and push it to GitHub.
   - For example:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Test webhook trigger"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Monitor Jenkins**:
   - Go to your Jenkins dashboard and open the job you created.
   - You should see a new build triggered automatically in the "Build History" section.
   - Click on the build number to view the build details and console output.

By following these steps, you should have a Jenkins job that automatically triggers a build whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
