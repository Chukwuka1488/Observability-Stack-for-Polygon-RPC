Sure! Here are the detailed steps to set up a Jenkins job that automatically triggers a build when you push to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create a Jenkins Job

1. **Access Jenkins Dashboard**:

   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-jenkins-server>:8080`.

2. **Create a New Item**:

   - Click on "New Item" on the left-hand side of the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Enter a name for your job (e.g., `Observability-Stack-Pipeline`).
   - Select "Pipeline" as the project type.
   - Click "OK" to create the job.

3. **Configure the Pipeline Job**:
   - In the job configuration page, scroll down to the "Pipeline" section.
   - Select "Pipeline script from SCM".
   - Choose "Git" as the SCM.
   - Enter your repository URL (`https://github.com/Chukwuka1488/Observability-Stack-for-Polygon-RPC`).
   - Specify the branch to build (e.g., `main`).
   - Click "Save" to save the job configuration.

### Step 2: Configure Webhooks in GitHub

1. **Access GitHub Repository Settings**:

   - Go to your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/Chukwuka1488/Observability-Stack-for-Polygon-RPC`).
   - Click on "Settings" in the repository menu.

2. **Add a Webhook**:
   - In the settings menu, click on "Webhooks".
   - Click on "Add webhook".
   - In the "Payload URL" field, enter the URL of your Jenkins server followed by `/github-webhook/` (e.g., `http://<your-jenkins-server>:8080/github-webhook/`).
   - Set the "Content type" to `application/json`.
   - Select "Just the push event" under "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?".
   - Click "Add webhook" to save the webhook configuration.

### Step 3: Configure Jenkins Job to Trigger on Push

1. **Access Jenkins Job Configuration**:

   - Go back to your Jenkins dashboard.
   - Click on the job you created (e.g., `Observability-Stack-Pipeline`).
   - Click on "Configure" on the left-hand side.

2. **Enable GitHub Hook Trigger**:
   - Scroll down to the "Build Triggers" section.
   - Check the box for "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling".
   - Click "Save" to save the job configuration.

### Step 4: Verify the Setup

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**:

   - Make a change to your repository and push it to GitHub.
   - For example:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Test webhook trigger"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Monitor Jenkins**:
   - Go to your Jenkins dashboard and open the job you created.
   - You should see a new build triggered automatically in the "Build History" section.
   - Click on the build number to view the build details and console output.

By following these steps, you should have a Jenkins job that automatically triggers a build whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

Got it! Since your Jenkins is installed via Helm in a Kubernetes cluster, you can verify and install Git on the Jenkins agent pod using the following steps:

### Step 1: Access the Jenkins Agent Pod

1. **List the Pods**:

   - First, list all the pods in the namespace where Jenkins is installed. For example, if Jenkins is installed in the `jenkins` namespace:
     ```sh
     kubectl get pods -n jenkins
     ```

2. **Identify the Jenkins Agent Pod**:

   - Look for the pod that corresponds to the Jenkins agent. It might have a name like `jenkins-agent-<random-string>`.

3. **Access the Jenkins Agent Pod**:
   - Use `kubectl exec` to access the Jenkins agent pod. Replace `<jenkins-agent-pod>` with the actual pod name:
     ```sh
     kubectl exec -it <jenkins-agent-pod> -n jenkins -- /bin/bash
     ```

### Step 2: Verify Git Installation

1. **Check Git Version**:

   - Once inside the Jenkins agent pod, run the following command to check if Git is installed and to verify its version:
     ```sh
     git --version
     ```
   - You should see an output similar to:
     ```sh
     git version 2.39.2
     ```

2. **Install Git (if not installed)**:
   - If Git is not installed, you can install it using the package manager available in the pod. For example, if the pod is based on a Debian/Ubuntu image:
     ```sh
     apt update
     apt install git
     ```

### Step 3: Restart Jenkins Agent Pod (if necessary)

1. **Restart the Jenkins Agent Pod**:
   - If you had to install Git, you might need to restart the Jenkins agent pod to ensure it picks up the new installation. You can do this by deleting the pod, and Kubernetes will automatically recreate it:
     ```sh
     kubectl delete pod <jenkins-agent-pod> -n jenkins
     ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that Git is installed on your Jenkins agent pod and verify its version. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

Great! Let's walk through the workflow of how the Jenkins job is triggered when you push new code to your GitHub repository:

### Workflow Overview

1. **Push Code to GitHub**:

   - You push new code to your GitHub repository.

2. **GitHub Webhook**:

   - The GitHub webhook is triggered by the push event. The webhook sends a payload to the Jenkins server's webhook URL.

3. **Jenkins Receives Webhook**:

   - Jenkins, exposed via the Ingress controller, receives the webhook payload at the configured URL (e.g., `http://jenkins.gm-nig-ltd.tech/github-webhook/`).

4. **Jenkins Job Triggered**:

   - Jenkins processes the webhook payload and triggers the corresponding Jenkins job (pipeline) defined in your repository.

5. **Pipeline Execution**:

   - The Jenkins pipeline defined in your `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your repository is executed. The pipeline stages are as follows:
     - **Test Git**: Verifies the Git installation.
     - **Checkout**: Clones the repository from GitHub.
     - **Build Docker Image**: Builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the specified directory.
     - **Push to Docker Hub**: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
     - **Update Kubernetes Manifests**: Updates the Kubernetes deployment manifest with the new Docker tag.
     - **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Applies the updated deployment manifest to the Kubernetes cluster.

6. **Post-Build Actions**:
   - Depending on the success or failure of the pipeline, Jenkins executes the post-build actions defined in the `post` section of the `Jenkinsfile`.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Push Code to GitHub**:

   - You make changes to your code and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

2. **GitHub Webhook**:

   - The configured webhook in your GitHub repository sends a payload to the Jenkins server's webhook URL:
     ```
     http://jenkins.gm-nig-ltd.tech/github-webhook/
     ```

3. **Jenkins Receives Webhook**:

   - Jenkins receives the webhook payload and identifies the corresponding job to trigger based on the repository and branch information.

4. **Jenkins Job Triggered**:

   - Jenkins triggers the pipeline job defined in your `Jenkinsfile`.

5. **Pipeline Execution**:

   - The pipeline stages are executed in the following order:
     - **Test Git**: Runs the `git --version` command to verify Git installation.
     - **Checkout**: Clones the repository from GitHub using the `git` step.
     - **Build Docker Image**: Builds the Docker image using the `docker.build` step.
     - **Push to Docker Hub**: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub using the `docker.withRegistry` and `docker.image` steps.
     - **Update Kubernetes Manifests**: Updates the Kubernetes deployment manifest with the new Docker tag using the `sh` step.
     - **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Applies the updated deployment manifest to the Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command.

6. **Post-Build Actions**:
   - If the pipeline succeeds, Jenkins prints a success message. If the pipeline fails, Jenkins prints a failure message.

By following this workflow, your Jenkins job will be automatically triggered whenever you push new code to your GitHub repository. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
