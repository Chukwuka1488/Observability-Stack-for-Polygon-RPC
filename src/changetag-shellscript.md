You can test your shell script locally by following these steps:

1. **Create a Test Environment**:

   - Make sure you have a copy of your `kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml` file in your local directory.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:

   - Ensure your script has executable permissions. You can do this by running:
     ```sh
     chmod +x changeTag.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   - Execute the script with a test tag version. For example:
     ```sh
     ./changeTag.sh v1.0.0
     ```

4. **Verify the Output**:
   - Check the contents of the `kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml` file to ensure the tag version has been correctly replaced.

Here's a step-by-step example:

```sh
# Step 1: Create a test environment
cp kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml.bak

# Step 2: Make the script executable
chmod +x changeTag.sh

# Step 3: Run the script with a test tag version
./changeTag.sh v1.0.0

# Step 4: Verify the output
cat kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml
```

This will help you confirm that your script is working as expected. If you encounter any issues, feel free to share the details, and we can troubleshoot further together! ðŸ˜Š
Sure! Let's break down the shell command first:

### Shell Command Explanation

```sh
#!/bin/sh
sed "s/tagVersion/$1/g" kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml > kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml.tmp && mv kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml.tmp kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml
```

1. **`#!/bin/sh`**: This is the shebang line that tells the system to use the `sh` shell to interpret the script.

2. **`sed "s/tagVersion/$1/g" kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml`**:

   - `sed`: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
   - `"s/tagVersion/$1/g"`: This is the substitution command in `sed`. It replaces all occurrences of `tagVersion` with the first argument passed to the script (`$1`).
   - `kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml`: The input file to be processed.

3. **`> kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml.tmp`**:

   - Redirects the output of the `sed` command to a temporary file (`deployment.yaml.tmp`).

4. **`&& mv kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml.tmp kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml`**:
   - `&&`: Logical AND operator that ensures the next command runs only if the previous command succeeds.
   - `mv kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml.tmp kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml`: Moves the temporary file to replace the original file.

### Python Equivalent

Now, let's do the same thing in Python:

```python
import sys

def replace_tag_version(file_path, tag_version):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()

    content = content.replace('tagVersion', tag_version)

    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python changeTag.py <file_path> <tag_version>")
        sys.exit(1)

    file_path = sys.argv[1]
    tag_version = sys.argv[2]

    replace_tag_version(file_path, tag_version)
```

### Explanation of the Python Script

1. **Importing `sys`**: This module provides access to command-line arguments.

2. **`replace_tag_version(file_path, tag_version)`**:

   - Opens the file specified by `file_path` for reading.
   - Reads the entire content of the file.
   - Replaces all occurrences of `tagVersion` with `tag_version`.
   - Opens the file for writing and writes the modified content back to the file.

3. **Main Block**:
   - Checks if the correct number of arguments is provided.
   - Extracts `file_path` and `tag_version` from the command-line arguments.
   - Calls the `replace_tag_version` function with the provided arguments.

### Running the Python Script

To run the Python script, use the following command:

```sh
python changeTag.py kubernetes-manifest/deployment.yaml v1.0.0
```

This will replace all occurrences of `tagVersion` with `v1.0.0` in the `deployment.yaml` file.
